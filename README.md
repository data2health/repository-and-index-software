# Repository and Index Software Comparison

## Summary
This is a list of **repositories, repository frameworks, and data catalogs**. It focuses on technical architecture, how metadata is handled and what standards are used, and what next-generation repository features (if any) are implemented.

Are you a tool steward or user?  Please visit the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhLmp2pwUyHLxOmOFmZFVUK1ft6r5QY9ffXRWdlT6BY/edit#gid=13546219) and share updates.  We are migrating these data to a wikipedia page.  Please contact the project team if you'd like to be part of this effort.  We'd love to hear your perspective!

## Purpose
We created this list to:

1. Provide a "lay of the land" summary of existing software
2. Identify important features (especially those that fall in the "next generation repository" category) for [InvenioRDM](https://github.com/data2health/InvenioRDM)
3. Identify other tools that may have some level of interoperability with our project

## Accessing the List
For now, the list is stored as a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhLmp2pwUyHLxOmOFmZFVUK1ft6r5QY9ffXRWdlT6BY/edit#gid=13546219).

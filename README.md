# Repository and Index Software Comparison

## Summary
This is a list of **repositories, repository frameworks, and data catalogs**. It focuses on technical architecture, how metadata is handled and what standards are used, and what next-generation repository features (if any) are implemented.

## Purpose
We created this list to:

1. Provide a "lay of the land" summary of existing software
2. Identify important features (especially those that fall in the "next generation repository" category) that we'll want to incorporate in our repository and data index project, [menRva](https://github.com/data2health/menRva).
3. Identify the tools that may have some level of interoperability with our project

## Accessing the List
For now, the list is stored as a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SJ7EFyvqRd1fe6ZqqTG2EzvCVCvl-T8Woiv8FgHTawQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Attribute Categories
Attributes are arranged using the following categories:

1. General
2. Architecture
3. Metadata handling
4. Next-gen repo features
5. Dissemination
6. Preservation
7. Coding
8. Additional Info

## Contribution
